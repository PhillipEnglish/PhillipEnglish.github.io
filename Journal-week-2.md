Journal Week 2:

Week two at the Iron Yard found us settling down into the modes and daily rituals of students at an intensive coding bootcamp: That is to say, we began to really dig in to coding projects- learning new concepts, and putting them into immediate use. 

I personally found getting adjusted to the daily and weekly routines at the Iron Yard- daily stand up,  goofing around with compatriots during lunch, Friday huddle and Iron Pints, to name a few- particularly useful as they provide a *framework* (coding reference intended) around which a lot of hard, mind-bending work and personal development can take place. Because I have a scaffolding of activities around which to format my day/week, I'm able to *parse* (intended reference once again) my daily schedule and manage my time and workflow better than in a standard college environment.

During week 2, the concepts of Human-Computer interaction were very much on my mind. As we began picking up new skills: *delegating communication between different views in Xcode, parsing info from Json files, managing new and interesting types of views from the UI-Kit* I couldn't help but notice that, not only was I spending more time with my machine than normal, but I was utilizing it for increasingly novel tasks. This brought forth a very meta awareness of my interaction with the computer to my consciousness. 

Wikipedia describes Human-Computer Interaction in the following manner: 
>The term connotes that, unlike other tools with only limited uses (such as a hammer, useful for driving nails, but not much else), a computer has many uses and this takes place as an open-ended dialog between the user and the computer. The notion of dialog likens human-computer interaction to human-to-human interaction, an analogy the discussion of which is crucial to theoretical considerations in the field<

My initial interest in H.C.I. came out of a desire to design better experiences for end users. As the further uses of Xcode, and the computer itself, unveil themselves, via the program at T.I.Y, I am increasingly interested in the interaction between the machine, and the programmer of the machine.  I look forward to further explorations and development as a programmer.
