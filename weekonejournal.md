*Explain how the user experience of your app should impact how you design and construct your code. How should user-focused considerations affect your code structure?*

User experience is a crucial element of application desing. Considerations of the experience of the end user should be taken to account at even the earliest stages of coding an application.  This is especially true when programming for mobile devices, where the human-machine interaction involves a plethora of gestures (shakes, swipes, camera interaction, gyroscopic movement, and so on...) not found in a standard computer terminal.

Of primary importance from the point of view of a developer is writing code that will operate seemlessly under the hood of the UI.  The MVC paradigm makes this particularly easy for a developer, as one can keep the view, it's controller, and the data (or model) that both are fed in an organized and separated pattern. This allows for quick debugging of the various parts, and in Xcode makes it very easy to see how your code interacts with the UI.  

Another way develop while focusing on User Experience is to iteratively design through a process that involves the User in each step.  As a trained anthropologist and ethnographer, I may be biased toward this particular paradigm, but I believe there's no better way to design than receiving input from the population that you are designing for at each stage of the process: from conception to completion.  This will allow you to see what features truly engage the user, and what interactions they find valuable, and it gives room for sorting out kinks in code.
